#: How long after its drop an antibiotic-clock anchor can still be restored (G2-A1, X12). Charting
#: suspected infection absent and then present again inside this is a correction of the toggle —
#: the same episode, whose hour is still running or already overdue; restarting it turned an
#: antibiotic 10 min overdue into "60 min remaining". The window runs from the drop, not from the
#: anchor, and is a correction's size: a mis-click is put right within minutes. A recognition after
#: it is a second episode with its own hour (D9) — a new infection after a rule-out must not
#: inherit the old anchor, and with it the doses given since (X12 review).

        # holds, and restarting an overdue antibiotic's hour then would hide that it is overdue.

        #    with its own hour. (The `None` branch below is defensive only: an anchor can exist
        #    only after infection was charted >= 1.) Sepsis merely stopping is not that: SOFA
        #    reads the latest MAP, so a single reading at 70 or above (MAP 70 scores 0) stops
        #    `sepsis` for one evaluation, and an anchor dropped then would let an untreated sepsis
        #    never go overdue, or give a treated one a false overdue when it came back.

        #    ANCHOR_RESTORE_S (15 min) of the drop restores the old anchor: infection charted absent
        #    and present again is a corrected toggle, the same episode, and an antibiotic charted in
        #    the gap counts against the restored hour. A later recognition gets its own anchor,
